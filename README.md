## SETUP

### Dependencies
Run `yarn install` to install dependencies in both client and api folders.

### Database Preparation
- Create `.env` file in the api directory and add `DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD` and `DB_NAME=myFridge`.

- Copy `mysql -u root -p -e "create database huayu"` into your terminal to create a database in MySQL.

- Copy the following into your terminal. This will create a three tables: "schools" with columns (id, university, center, location, city, coordinates, map, website), "reviews" with columns (id, user_id, school_id, created_at, title, start_date, end_date, likes, dislikes, city_impression, general_review), and "cities" with column names (id, ).
`CREATE TABLE schools (id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, university VARCHAR(100) not null, center VARCHAR(100) not null, location VARCHAR(25) not null, city VARCHAR(100) not null, coordinates VARCHAR(30) not null, map VARCHAR(500) not null, website VARCHAR(500) not null, PRIMARY KEY (id));`
`CREATE TABLE reviews (id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, user_id INT(11) not null, school_id INT(11) NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP, title VARCHAR(25), start_date DATE, end_date DATE, likes VARCHAR(300), dislikes VARCHAR(300), city_impression VARCHAR(300), general_review VARCHAR(300), PRIMARY KEY (id));`
`CREATE TABLE cities (id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, city VARCHAR(50) not null, population TINYINT(11) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id));`


- Populate tables "schools" and "cities" by importing the .csv tables in a database manager such as Sequel Pro or TablePlus. [Schools Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FI84o7h2kZho0xvpw5f4r3-8LSXVAJrsnGgk33tVW7U/edit?usp=sharing) , [Cities Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nga06CnlZ1_4TxYAL_edX3c2_k4hzNk4tO1iJyFkNmk/edit?usp=sharing)
